<h1>Pointers and arrays</h1>

<h2>Pointers</h2>

<p>A pointer is a variable which contains a memory address.</p>

<h1>Arrays</h1>

Arrays in C are contiguous memory areas that hold a number of values of the same type. Unlike some other languages, in C, all elements of an array have the same type. To declare an array we use this syntax: type var_name[number_of_elements];, where number_of_elements is the number of elements of type type that we need.
